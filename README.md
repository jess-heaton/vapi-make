Translation Agent Architecture Overview
Two-Call Bridge System: Creates two separate VAPI calls that communicate through Make.com automation scenarios - one outbound phone call to the client and one web call for the admin.

Call Initiation: When an admin starts a session via the web interface, it triggers two actions: (1) an outbound VAPI call is made to the client's phone number, and (2) a web VAPI call starts for the admin in their browser. Both calls share a unique session ID stored in Google Sheets.

Real-Time Translation Flow: When either person speaks, their VAPI assistant detects the need to translate and calls a "last_utterance" tool function. This triggers a Make webhook that: (1) runs the speech through an AI translation agent, (2) looks up the paired call's control URL in Google Sheets using the session ID, and (3) sends the translated message to the other person's call via VAPI's control API.

Dynamic Data Integration: During live translation, the system can pull real-time availability calendars, property information, pricing data, or inventory status through additional Make integrations. This contextual information gets naturally woven into the translated conversation flow, allowing the admin to provide accurate, up-to-date responses without breaking conversation rhythm.

Session Management: Google Sheets acts as the central registry, storing session IDs with their corresponding control URLs for both the client call (outbound) and admin call (web). This allows the Make scenarios to route translations between the correct paired calls.

Bi-Directional Communication: Both assistants have the same translation tool, so conversation flows naturally in both directions - client speaks in their language → translated to admin, admin responds → translated back to client, maintaining real-time conversation flow across language barriers.

Post-Call Debrief & Follow-Up: After the client disconnects, the system switches the admin to debrief mode where they can schedule follow-up meetings, send invoices, create calendar appointments, and receive AI-powered coaching suggestions (like reminding them to request a Google review, send a proposal within 24 hours, or follow up on specific client concerns that were mentioned during the call).
